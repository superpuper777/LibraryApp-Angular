    name: 'The Case of the Perjured Parrot',
    author: 'Erle Stanley Gardner',
    genre: 'detective novels',
    summary: `One of Perry Mason's trademarks is his ability, in court, to switch the physical evidence in a case. He generally does this with guns or bullets, and it confuses the jury, to his client's advantage. In this case, Perry offers a coroner's inquest two parrots, one of which swore like a muleskinner and was found near the body of a millionaire hermit who had been murdered.
    Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime: "This early Perry Mason is uncommonly full of detection, and the games played in it with parrots do not detract from plausibility. Denouement not huddled—all in all, a model in his special genre."`,

    biography: `Daniel Defoe (/dɪˈfoʊ/; c. 1660 – 24 April 1731), born Daniel Foe, was an English trader,
    writer, journalist, pamphleteer and spy. He is most famous for his novel Robinson Crusoe, published
    in 1719, which is claimed to be second only to the Bible in its number of translations. He has been seen
    as one of the earliest proponents of the English novel, and helped to popularise the form in Britain
    with others such as Aphra Behn and Samuel Richardson. Defoe wrote many political tracts and 
    was often in trouble with the authorities, and spent a period in prison. 
    Intellectuals and political leaders paid attention to his fresh ideas and sometimes consulted 
    with him.
    Defoe was a prolific and versatile writer, producing more than three hundred works—books, pamphlets,
    and journals—on diverse topics, including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology, 
    and the supernatural. He was also a pioneer of business journalism and economic journalism.`,
